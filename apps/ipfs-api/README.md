## IPFS Proxy API

Proxy server for storing files on IPFS via [Fleek](https://fleek.xyz/). Fleek requires API keys which we can't expose to the frontend, hence the need for a backend server.

Make sure you have a valid `.env` file in this package's root directory. See `.env.example` for an example.
