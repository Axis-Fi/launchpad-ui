# Contributing to Axis launchpad

> Axis launchpad is a UI kit for bootstrapping your own token launchpad with multichain support. It provides a user interface for enabling the creation of token sales and participation in the sales. It interacts with the [Axis smart contracts](https://github.com/Axis-Fi/axis-core) and the [Axis Subgraph](https://github.com/Axis-Fi/subgraph) for querying token sales data.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Axis `launchpad`. This guide will help you understand our development process and how to contribute effectively.
